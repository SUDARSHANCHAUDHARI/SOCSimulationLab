End-to-end SOC workflow simulator that maps attack scenarios to collected logs and visibility gaps.

- **Portfolio group:** Cybersecurity lab project
- **Status:** MVP implemented, tested, committed, and pushed to GitHub
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/SUDARSHANCHAUDHARI/SOCSimulationLab
- **Local path:** `/Users/screencloudsudarshan/SUDARSHAN_CODE/sudarshan_repos/CyberSecurity/SOCSimulationLab`

## MVP Snapshot

This repository includes a working MVP with safe sample data, deterministic detection or analysis logic, local tests, and generated output reports where relevant. It is ready for README/demo polish or deeper product work.

## Safe Use

This project is defensive and analysis-focused. Use only with logs, systems, repositories, and lab environments you own or have permission to assess.

## Core Features

- attack chain timeline
- log collection
- detection mapping
- gap analysis
- final SOC report

## Safety Note

Keep this local and lab-only.

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 soc_simulation.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

The simulation uses safe synthetic logs. It does not run exploit tooling.

## MVP Capabilities

- Loads expected scan, login, and shell signals from scenario files
- Runs deterministic detection logic against collected SOC logs
- Builds an incident timeline
- Builds a visibility gap report
- Writes machine-readable detection output

## Roadmap

- Polish sample output screenshots or terminal demos
- Add architecture diagram and deeper implementation notes
- Expand test coverage around edge cases
- Add Docker or local demo workflow where useful
- Prepare `v0.1.0-mvp` release notes
